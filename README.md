## Specification

Shuffling arrays in constant time is a common problem in modern cryptography. This project involves analyzing the technique proposed in https://cr.yp.to/2024/insertionseries-20240515.py, and implementing it in C, possibly employing parallelization.


## How to run

The steps below refer to a Unix environment, for other environments the commands may change.


## Contribute

- If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [Alessandro Conti](mailto:ale.conti.1101@gmail.com) instead.
- If you find a bug or error or want to add some other function that is not implemented yet
    1. **FORK** the repo
    2. **CLONE** the project to your own machine
    3. **COMMIT** to your own branch
    4. **PUSH** your work back up to your fork
    5. submit a **PULL REQUEST** so that I can review your changes
  > NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!


### Code Style

Each new function must be documented using the following style:
- *Short function description*: A brief description explaining what the function does.
- *@warning*: A section listing all the assumptions made by the function, such as the preconditions that the parameters must fulfil.
- *Blank line*: Add a blank line to separate the documentation sections.
- *@details*: A detailed section describing how the function works, explaining the algorithms and logic used.
- *Blank line*: Add a blank line to separate the documentation sections.
- *@param*: A list of the parameters required by the function, each accompanied by a brief description of its role and type.
- *@return*: A description of what the function returns, including the data type.

In general, any additional comments that might improve understanding of the code are welcome. ðŸ˜ƒ
